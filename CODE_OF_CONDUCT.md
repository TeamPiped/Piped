# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include but are not limited to:

-   The usage of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, threats, and personal or political attacks
-   Harassment of any form
-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission from the individual
-   Derailling conversations unnecessarily in a way that is not constructive, such as repeatedly posting off-topic comments whilest not in an off-topic channel
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the contact section of the project README, or alternatively any admin of an official medium community. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
