An open-source alternative frontend for YouTube which is efficient by design.

# The Problem

YouTube has an extremely invasive privacy policy which relies on using user data in unethical ways. You give them a lot of data - ranging from ideas, music taste, content, political opinions, and much more than you think.

By using Piped, you can freely watch and listen to content without the fear of prying eyes watching everything you are doing.
